        <p>Emily Dickinson is known for her frequent usage of dashes in her poetry. While this is not entirely unique, it is something that she used in abundance and something
            that the editors changed quite often in the published editions of Dickinson's poems. Since the dashes were changed so often, our group decided to use their presence 
        in the poems to measure how true the sampled published versions were to Dickinson's original manuscripts. This graph measures the percentage of dashes that were removed in 
        the published versions.</p>
    <p>
        This graph uses colored dots to represent the published versions of the poems. In the legend at the top of the graph, the published versions are represented in their respectively
        colored dots with abbreviations. The abbreviations are as follows: CE = "Centenary Edition"; LSD = "Letter to Susan Dickinson"; AM = "Atlantic Monthly"; BM = "Bolts of Melody"; 
        FH = "Final Harvest"; FP = "Further Poems"; POEMS3 = 1896 "Poems", Third Series, edited by Mabel Loomis Todd; POEMS2 = 1891 "Poems", Second Series, edited by Mabel Loomis Todd and Thomas Wentworth Higginson;
        and POEMS1 = 1890 "Poems", edited by Mabel Loomis Todd and Thomas Wentworth Higginson.</p>
   <p>
       The published editions that replaced the dashes the most will appear closer to the top, near the 100% line. The editions that represented the dashes closest to Dickinson's
       original manuscript will appear closer to the bottom. Dots located directly on the bottom line respresent published editions that left the dashes as they appear in the manuscripts.
       If a poem is not represented in a specific edition, the dot will simply not be displayed.
